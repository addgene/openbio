# Setting up your development environment in a Mac

You will use the Terminal application to run a script that installs everything you need. A few notes on the Terminal app:
* The Terminal application can be launched by going to Applications > Utilities and double clicking on Terminal. We suggest adding this application to your Dock.
* In the procedure below, commands that you need to type in the Terminal window are in `this font`.
* While on the Terminal, you can use TAB to complete a command after typing a few letters. Hit ENTER to execute the command. Use the Up arrow to get to the previous commands.

## Procedure
1. [Download](https://github.com/addgene/openbio/archive/master.zip) the `addgene/openbio` GitHub repository and move it to your Home folder.
1. Unzip it by double clicking on it. The top-level folder is called `openbio-master`
1. Launch the Terminal application and navigate to the setup folder:
    ```
    cd openbio-master/setup
    ```
1. Type the following command:
    ```
    ./setup-openbio-workstation.sh
    ```
    This does two things in parallel:
    * Launches installation of XCode, a set of Mac tools for developers - you’ll see this in a separate window.
    * Downloads and configures everything else you need - you’ll see text scrolling in the Terminal indicating what’s going on. At some point you may be asked for your password - this is the password you use for your local Mac account.
1. When the script is done, you’ll see a success message. Close your Terminal window and open a new one so everything is loaded freshly.
1. Test that you can run Python code:
    * Activate your Python environment - after this, the prompt in the Terminal changes to indicate your environment (openbio) is active:
    ```
    workon openbio
    ```
    
    * Navigate to the toolkit folder: 
    ```
    cd openbio-master/toolkit
    ```
    * Execute the `atk.py` command with the `--help` option to see a help message:
    ```
    python atk.py --help
    ```
1. In order to use the toolkit, you will need to enter your own parameters in a Python file (`parameters.py`), which can be done with any text editor. Because XCode was installed, your Mac will want to open `.py` files with XCode, which we don’t want. The first time you need to edit a Python file, right click on the file and choose “Open with…”. To permanently associate a text editor with `.py` files: select the file and hit Command-i, go to the “Open with” section and select your favorite text editor - if you don’t have a favorite, just use TextEdit.app.
