# Background
Addgene is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to accelerate research and discovery by improving access to useful research materials and information. Since the company was founded in 2004, scientists have shared more than 70,000 unique published reagent samples via Addgeneâ€™s repository. We have also fulfilled requests for more than 1 million plasmid, viral vector, and other material types to scientists in 100 countries.

Addgene conducts a rigurous quality control process for all [plasmids](https://blog.addgene.org/plasmids-101-an-inside-look-at-ngs-plasmid-quality-control) and 
[viral vectors](https://blog.addgene.org/aav-vector-quality-control-going-the-extra-mile). Part of this quality control involves sequencing the materials using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS/VGS). [explain better!]. As our NGS and VGS data grows, so has our need for automating parts of our analysis. We do so through internally developed bioinformatics tools. Our language of choice is Python.

The aim of this code repository is to make these tools available to the broader scientific community.
Stay tuned as *the Addgene Toolkit* grows!

# Setting up your Python environment
First of all, clone or [download](https://github.com/addgene/openbio/archive/master.zip) this repository. 
If you already have a Python environment of your liking, you simply need to do:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt`
```
and move on.

We have included here a shell script we use internally to set up everything in a Mac. To use this script, you need to have admin privileges. Instructions are here.
