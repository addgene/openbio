# Setting up your development environment on a Mac

In order to use this procedure, you need to have admin privileges on your Mac. This is normally the case if you're working on your personal Mac. If you're using a Mac provided by your institution, and you get errors during the procedure, please seek assistance from your IT department, as every institution does things slightly differently!

You will use the Terminal application to run a script that installs everything you need. A few notes on the Terminal app:
* The Terminal app can be launched by going to Applications > Utilities and double clicking on Terminal. We suggest adding this application to your Dock.
* In the procedure below, commands that you need to type in the Terminal window are in `this font`.
* Cheat sheet for the Terminal app:
  * Use TAB to complete a command or file name after typing a few letters. 
  * Hit ENTER to execute the command. 
  * Use Ctrl-C to interrupt a command.
  * Use the Up arrow to get to the previously typed commands.

## Procedure
1. [Download](https://github.com/addgene/openbio/archive/master.zip) the `addgene/openbio` GitHub repository and move it to your Home folder.
1. Unzip it by double clicking on it. The top-level folder is called `openbio-master`
1. Launch the Terminal application and navigate to the setup folder:
    ```
    cd openbio-master/setup
    ```
1. Type the following command:
    ```
    ./setup-openbio-workstation.sh
    ```
    This may take a while, especially the first time you do it, so please be patient. The command does two things:
    * Launches installation of XCode, a set of Mac tools for developers - you’ll see this in a separate window. Please follow the prompts in this separate window and, when the installation finishes, return to the Terminal and follow the instructions.
    * Downloads and configures everything else you need - you’ll see text scrolling in the Terminal indicating what’s going on.     At some point you may be asked for your password - this is the password you use for your local Mac account.
1. When the command is done, you’ll see a success message. Close your Terminal window and open a new one so everything is loaded freshly.
1. Test that you can run Python 3 code:
    * Activate your Python environment - after this, the prompt in the Terminal changes to indicate your environment (openbio) is active:
    ```
    workon openbio
    ```
    
    * Navigate to the toolkit folder: 
    ```
    cd openbio-master/toolkit
    ```
    * Execute the `atk.py` command with the `--help` option. If you see a help message for the toolkit, everything worked:
    ```
    python atk.py --help
    ```
1. In order to use the toolkit, you will need to enter your own parameters in a Python file (`parameters.py`), which can be done with any text editor. Because XCode was installed, your Mac will want to open `.py` files with XCode, which you probably don’t want. The first time you need to edit a Python file, right click on the file and choose “Open with…”. To permanently associate a text editor with `.py` files: select the file and hit Command-i, go to the “Open with” section and select your favorite text editor - if you don’t have a favorite, just use TextEdit.app.

## Maintenance
Please run the setup script periodically to pick up any new updates.

If something goes wrong or you wish to start allover, the setup script has an option to completely delete the install directory. Use it cautiously:
```
./setup-openbio-workstation.sh nuke
```
