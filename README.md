The Research Team is using this software to detect specific sequences in the capsid genes, thereby differentiating between various serotypes.
The scriptâ€™s parameters can be modified by editing the file parameters.py. To change the parameter values, locate the block named Serotype_Report_Parameters and follow the examples in the file, paying special attention to the use of double quotes for all text. The parameters are:
input_folder - folder where the FASTQ files are. Full path or relative to the tools folder.
output_folder - folder for the output CSV files. Full path or relative to the tools folder.
signatures - name and sequence of the signatures to look for. Add as many as you want, following the example syntax and separated by commas.
